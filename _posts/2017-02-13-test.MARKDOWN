Software systems can be complicated, and I meanÂ **really** complicated&#8230; the kind of complicated that would make an otherwise sane developer want to run out of the room screaming. Unfortunately this is a world a lot of enterprise developers experience on an almost daily basis. We can try to console ourselves by mumbling something about the necessary complexities due to business processes or the wildly disparate systems needing to communicate with each other through some form of arcane hand-waving and astrological signals. These platitudes doesn&#8217;t really help us when we have to go to battle with the system on a daily basis to try and shore-up ailing processes or implement the nice new shiny features being requested by the business. To cope with this complexity, what we need is action&#8230; decisive action that will eliminate all these cognitive land-mines and make our lives bearable again: we need a system design to bring order to the chaos. Enter the enterprise architects, our saviours!
