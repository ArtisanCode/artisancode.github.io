This is the area where I talk a little bit about myself, what I believe in (from a software perspective), and what sort of projects I've worked on over my career. Think of this page a bit like an online CV without it being too formal. When it comes to software I'm a firm believer in software design. It's almost impossible to understate the importance of a good solution design. I believe that tools like TDD can help you arrive at a design which meets all the [SOLID principles][1]. Once you have a (testable) design in place, one of the other aspects of software that I'm very keen on is the testing required to ensure that the developed solution works as expected. One of these days I'll get round to writing a few posts to articulate and elucidate these points a bit better.
